**Author**: Ediberto Ponce
**Version**: 1.0.0

- PR: [https://github.com/ponceedi000/madlib-cli/pull/1](https://github.com/ponceedi000/madlib-cli/pull/1)

## Overview

- Today i got to practice test-driven development with my fellow classmates. We ran a total of 17 tests that check for the following:
- A Band instance should have a name attribute which is a string.
- A Band instance should have a members attribute which is a list of instances that inherit from Musician base (or super) class.
- A Band instance should have a play_solos method that asks each member musician to play a solo, in the order they were added to band.
- A Band instance should have appropriate __str__ and __repr__ methods.
- A Band should have a class method to_list which returns a list of previously created Band instances

- We approached these tests step by step and refrained from skiping tests. This made coding suprisngly easier when we broke into steps!
